Super Meat Boy is an independent video game designed by Edmund McMillen (pictured) and Tommy Refenes and developed by Team Meat. The successor to the 2008 Flash game Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy was released on the Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade in October 2010 and on Microsoft Windows in November 2010. It was ported to OS X and Linux in 2011, to the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in 2015, and to the Wii U in 2016. In the game the player controls Meat Boy, a red, cube-shaped character, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend, Bandage Girl, from the game's antagonist Dr. Fetus. The platform gameplay is characterized by fine control and split-second timing as the player runs and jumps through over 300 hazardous levels while avoiding obstacles. The game sold over 1,000,000 copies by January 2012, and was critically acclaimed. In 2010, it received awards for Most Challenging Game from IGN and for Best Downloadable Game from GameSpot and GameTrailers, as well as a nomination for the Grand Prize at the 2010 Independent Games Festival. Critics lauded the game's difficulty, precise control, retro artwork, and soundtrack
